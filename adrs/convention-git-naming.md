# Convention – Git naming

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) convention to make sure our commits are readable and unified. We can use one of the predefined prefixes: `feat`, `fix`, `style`, `docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test` and more, then the scope of the ticket (Board ticket) and description, for example:

```
feat(MAS-123): implement foo bar
```

For branches, we use the same prefixes, then the scope of the ticket (Board ticket) and an optional description, for example:

```
feat/MAS-123-foobar
```
